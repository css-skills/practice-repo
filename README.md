# practice-repo

This repository contains practice materials for the [Introduction to Git and GitHub workshop](https://css-skills.uchicago.edu/posts/2022-03-08-introduction-to-git-and-github/).

There are two relevant files:

- `gun-deaths.Rmd` - an R Markdown file containing a basic report on the `rcfss::gun_deaths` data frame
- `gun-deaths.R` - an R script reproducing the same analysis as in the Rmd file
